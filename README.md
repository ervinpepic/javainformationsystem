# javainformationsystem

This application is fully written in Java using JDK 8, NetBeans 8 also support 8.1 and SQLite database. This app is for students 
on International University, in Novi Pazar, Serbia. And all purpose of this java app is for education. External libraries that I 
use for this app is:

* itextpdf-5.5.4.jar
* jdatepicker-1.3.4-javadoc.jar
* rs2xml.jar

This app is created on MacOSHighSierra but also is working on windows and all operating system since java is platform indepented programming language.
